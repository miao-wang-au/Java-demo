# Java-automation-demo

This is my Maven project for automation testing, adopting TestNG framework. 
Under src/test/java/ are the programs I wrote to demonstrate my Java programming ability. 

CompareTwoCSV.java is the java Class to compare the two CSV files by parsing the files using java.nio.file library and comparing the individual line items using a For loop.
